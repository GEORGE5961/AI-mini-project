The project is "Image classification on CIFAR10 dataset"

The CIFAR dataset link is

**Step 1:** 

write a short paragraph to describe your understanding of image classification task. Also please include a plan (e.g., overall system flowchart), expected outputs and anything you think it should be included.

**Step 2:** 

build a basic <mark>Alex net</mark> using tensorflow from scratch. Train the net using CIFAR training data. Use <mark>Tensorboard</mark> to help visualize and analyze the training and testing procedure.

**Step 3:** 

Use <mark>pre-trained deep model (VGG or ResNet-18)</mark> to build image classification model, i.e., fine-tune with CIFAR dataset.  Use Tensorboard to help visualize and analyze the training and testing procedure.

**Step 4:** 

Analyse training/testing error and prepare the report for your observation and conclusion.
